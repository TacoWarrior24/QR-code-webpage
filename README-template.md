### What I learned

This Project was a nice little stepping stone for me to my more ambitious project of making a full live website. This project allowed me to experiment with building a webpage linked to GitHub from the ground up. This project also taught me that CSS styles can be stored in the HTML file and don't nessisarily need to be a seperate file. 

```html styles
<h1><style>
    .main {
      margin: 100px auto;
      width: 300px;
      height: auto;
      padding: 10px;
      background-color: white;    
      text-align: center;
      border-radius: 25px;
      font-family: Outfit;
    }
    .main img { border-radius: 5%;}
    .main p {padding: 10px;}
    .main p {padding: 10px;}
    .attribution { font-size: 11px; text-align: center; }
    .attribution a { color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%); }
  </style></h1>
```


### Continued development

Moving forward I want to continue refining my webdevelopment skills and develop a web page that showcases my portfolio. I will need to look into hosting services as well as databases for website data.


### Useful resources

No real useful resources just some guidance from Frontend Mentor (Link Bellbow )
